NOTE from David:
Hey Vic. You asked me what pieces of admin I had to do during the league. Coaches would mostly take care of their own rosters.

I'd need to do the following:

At start of league:
Update TeamData with any new/changed rules
Create sheet for each team. The one for returning teams is different from the one for new teams.
Update League_Table and Matchup_counts with new teams
Check each roster for errors after the coach has entered the team.

Every month:
Figure out the fixtures and update Fixtures_Results sheet.
Notify the group.

After each game:
Update League_Table sheet stats and reorder teams.
Enter results into Fixtures_Results sheet.
Update Matchup_counts sheet.

At end of season:
Manually go through each roster and update Glittering_PrizesÂ spreadsheet
